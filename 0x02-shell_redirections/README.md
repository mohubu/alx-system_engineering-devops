# 0x02. Shell, I/O Redirections and filters


Shell, I/O Redirections, and Filters are essential concepts in the Unix/Linux command-line environment that allow for efficient data processing and manipulation. I/O (Input/Output) redirections allow you to control where the input comes from and where the output goes. They enable you to redirect the standard input, standard output, and standard error of a command or a pipeline of commands.
